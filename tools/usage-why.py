"""
Why does the panel show this usage number?

Run this ON THE SERVER. It answers one question with facts instead of
guesses: is the usage figure the panel shows the real total, and if not,
why not.

It checks, in order, the four things that can go wrong:

  1. Is the running panel new enough to track usage across resets?
     (the `last_used` / `used_before` columns only exist from 1.66.0)
  2. Has the tracker ever observed these clients? A client the panel has
     never looked at has no baseline, so a reset before that moment is
     gone for good.
  3. What does x-ui report right now, and what has the panel banked from
     earlier (pre-reset) periods?
  4. Do the numbers the API would return match what x-ui holds?

Output is English on purpose: Persian right-to-left text mixes badly with
left-to-right terminal output, and this is meant to be copied and pasted.

No password, token, customer name or phone number is printed. Client
emails are shortened.
