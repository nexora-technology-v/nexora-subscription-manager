"""
Correct wallet order statuses recorded before the status fix.

An order's status is what every sales figure counts. Two paths wrote it
wrongly, in opposite directions:

  * A wallet purchase was never marked approved. The config was built and
    delivered, the order stayed `pending`, and the sweeper marked it
    `expired` half an hour later. A real sale, in no figure at all.

  * An auto-renewal was marked approved BEFORE the config was built. When
    the panel call failed the money went back but the order stayed
    approved - refunded money counted as a sale. A stuck subscription is
    retried with backoff and never abandoned, so it added several phantom
    sales a day.

The code no longer does either. This repairs the rows already written.

What identifies them: `sub_id` is set only after the panel call succeeds.
So a wallet order with a config is a real sale, and a renewal without one
is not.

Output is English on purpose: right-to-left text mixes badly with
left-to-right terminal output.

    python3 tools/repair-orders.py            # show what would change
    python3 tools/repair-orders.py --apply    # write it

Running it twice is safe: the second run finds nothing, because the rows
no longer match.
