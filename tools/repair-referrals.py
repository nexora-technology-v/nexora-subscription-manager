"""
Pay the referral coins that wallet purchases never paid.

The bot tells people: any friend who comes through your link and buys
earns you N coins. It does not mention how the friend pays.

But the reward only ran on the card-approval path. A friend who paid from
their wallet balance, or whose subscription renewed automatically, earned
their inviter nothing. The sales-partner commission covered all three
paths; the referral reward covered one.

The code now pays on all three. This finds the people who were promised
coins before that and never got them.

Coins are a discount, so this hands out real value. It shows what it would
pay and writes nothing unless you pass --apply.

Output is English on purpose: right-to-left text mixes badly with
left-to-right terminal output.

    python3 tools/repair-referrals.py            # show who is owed
    python3 tools/repair-referrals.py --apply    # pay them

Running it twice is safe: paying goes through the same once-per-friend
rule the bot uses, so a second run finds nothing.
