"""
Bring prepaid top-ups into the accounting books.

Until now two money systems ran side by side and never spoke. A postpaid
reseller pays at month end and it is stored in `payments`, which every
accounting screen reads. A prepaid reseller pays up front and it was
stored only in `credit_tx`, which none of them read.

So money that really arrived was missing from "received" and from the
profit figure, and a reseller who had already paid showed up as owing the
full amount.

New top-ups are recorded in both places from now on. This imports the ones
made before that.

Output is English on purpose: right-to-left text mixes badly with
left-to-right terminal output.

    python3 tools/import-topups.py            # show what would be imported
    python3 tools/import-topups.py --apply    # write them

Running it twice is safe: every imported row is tagged with the credit_tx
id it came from, and tagged rows are skipped.
